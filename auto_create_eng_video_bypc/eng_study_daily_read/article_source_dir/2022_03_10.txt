Big brands and oil ban punish Russia as Moscow makes new pledge on Ukraine refugees
A U.S ban on imports of Russia's oil ratcheted up punishment for the invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday as McDonald's and Starbucks closed outlets and Moscow promised safe passage for some people to flee. Several of the most internationally famous brands added to the Kremlin's global isolation on the 13th day of the incursion. Washington, meanwhile, imposed and immediate ban on imports of Russian energy, sparking a further increase in the oil price, which rose around 4% on Tuesday.
