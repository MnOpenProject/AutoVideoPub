Experts fear Japan may accelerate plan to dump Fukushima wastewater
A magnitude 7.4 earthquake rattled northeastern Japan late Wednesday night, including Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, which was devastated by a 9.0 quake in 2011 that triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Some Chinese citizens in Japan and analysts expressed deep concern over the safety of the nuclear facilities and worry that lapan may accelerate its plan to discharge contaminated water into the sea.
