China Announces 1 Million Internships to Tackle Unemployment
Chinese authorities are planning to make 1 million interships available in the public sector for those still unemployed after graduation. Known as jianxi, the government-arranged interships are monthslong assignments working at either government offices or state-owned companies. The initiative plans to recruit unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24 or those graduated within the last two years, and promises interns with basic living expenses and personal accident insurance.
