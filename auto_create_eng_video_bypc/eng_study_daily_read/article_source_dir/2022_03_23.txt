NASA's Giant Moon Rocket Reaches the Launchpad for the First Time
NASA's giant new moon rocket is finally at the launchpad, although it is yet to be determined when it might finally leave Earth. For the first time on Thursday evening, a fully stacked Space Launch System rocket and its accompanying launch tower emerged from the Vehicle Assembly Building (Essentially a huge garage for rockets) at the Kennedy Space Center in Fiorida. The rocket reached its destination at 4:15 a.m. on Friday, NASA said.
